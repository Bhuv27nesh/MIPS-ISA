# MIPS-ISA
The MIPS ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) is a 32-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture known for its simplicity and efficiency.  
It uses fixed-length 32-bit instructions, making decoding and pipelining easier in hardware.  
MIPS supports three main instruction formats — R-type, I-type, and J-type — to perform arithmetic, memory access, and control operations.
